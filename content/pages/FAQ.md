      - question: My phone fell into water. Should I put it in rice?
        id: water-damage-tag
        answer:
          - >-
            Save your rice for cooking. Rice not only does not help, but it can
            also cause more damage by making your charging port dirty. When your
            phone falls into water you need to bring it to a phone repair shop,
            so they can open it and dry it out. However, you can improve your
            phone’s chances of surviving by not pressing any buttons and just
            submerging it in rubbing alcohol (70% alcohol, plus). This may seem
            counterintuitive, but it is not the water itself that causes your
            phone to short circuit; rather, it is the minerals found in water
            (something rubbing alcohol does not have). The rubbing alcohol may
            save your phone while you are waiting to bring it to a repair shop.
      - question: Do you fix flip phones?
        answer:
          - >-
            Yes we fix most flip phones. Give us a call, so we can provide more
            information about our services.
      - question: Are your replacement parts original?
        answer:
          - >-
            Unless we can salvage a part from another phone, all parts are
            aftermarket. This is the case because top phone and tablet
            manufacturers do not sell original parts for their products.
      - question: Which repairs are covered by your 90 day warranty?
        answer:
          - >-
            All repairs! We stand behind our work. So if something we fixed
            stops working, bring it back to us and we’ll make it right.
      - question: >-
          You recently fixed my cracked screen, but now my speaker is no longer
          working. Is that covered by your warranty?
        answer:
          - >-
            Sorry. No. Unless the speaker has stopped working due to the repair
            we conducted. The same goes for any damages not related to our work.
      - question: >-
          What happens if iRepair4U cannot save my damaged phone? Do I still
          need to pay for the attempt?
        answer:
          - >-
            Depends. With some repairs, such as screen repairs, battery
            replacements,speaker repairs, etc., we will not charge you if we
            cannot fix your device. However, when it comes to water damage
            repairs, it is uncertain if the phone can be recovered and
            oftentimes there is nothing we can do to save the device. With those
            kinds of services we may still charge a fee.
      - question: Can I bring my phone over any time during business hours?
        answer:
          - >-
            You can, but we would recommend calling us first, so we can make
            time for you and provide more information about your repair. We also
            may not cover your device or have the necessary parts in stock at
            the moment, so we suggest giving us a call beforehand.
      - question: Do you list repair prices?
        answer:
          - >-
            Unfortunately, no. Prices may vary depending on fluctuating prices
            for parts. Give us a call, so we can give you a quote!
